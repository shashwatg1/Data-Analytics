# Text Analytics

* A simple technique used is called **Bag of words**. It counts the number of times each word appears in a text.<br>

* **Cleaning the data** is also very important which includes removing puncuation, dealing with upper and lower case issues, etc.<br>

* We also remove **Soft words**. These are unhelpful words like the, is, at, which, etc. This is prone to issues though as some of these soft words might have significant meaning.<br>

* **Stemming** is a reduction algorithm that makes words like argue, arguing, argued, etc the same word.<br>
