# Linear Optimisation

We perform optimisation using spreadsheet software<br>
We may use LibreOffice Calc, OpenOffice Calc, or Microsoft Excel<br>
I have used **LibreOffice** for this unit, as it is open-source (along with OpenOffice)<br>

When we make a prediction/forecast, it will have errors and hence the sensitivity must be known to ensure it is not very erroneous. Thus during linear optimisation, we assume some forecast has been made already.
