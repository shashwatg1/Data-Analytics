Q 1. 
Linear optimisation for radiation therapy. Data is collected from CT scans.
Each structure of brain is discretized into voxels.
The CT scans tell us the dose each beamlet delivers to each voxel.

Say there are 9 voxels and 6 beamlets

Voxel structure:

b b b
e e e
a a a
m m m
l l l
e e e
t t t
4 5 6
| | |

1 2 3 <- beamlet 1
4 5 6 <- beamlet 2
7 8 9 <- beamlet 3

say 2,4,7,8 have tumor, 5 is spinal cord and others are healthy.

Minimise the total dose to healthy tissues (spinal + other)

Constraints: tumor voxels must get atleast 7 Gy and spinal cord must get at most 5 Gy

We know the dose each beamlet gives to the tissues at unit intensity

Decision variables : all the intensities for the 6 beamlets
